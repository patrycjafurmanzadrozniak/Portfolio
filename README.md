## About me
<p>My name is Patrycja Furman-Zadrożniak. I am manual tester trainee and aspiring QA engineer and happy to share with you my work and ideas.</p>
<p>I have an artistic background. I've played violin my whole life and became a concertmaster in Music Theatre Poznań. I’m a very well organized, passionate for excellence and have always been result oriented. My music passion and career as Violinist taught me the importance of rigor learning, attention to detail and practice in developing skills needed to deliver great performance.</p>
<p>Now, I am leveraging the same skills to develop my IT knowledge aiming to be part of a great team in a company that would help individuals with skills like mine, apply them to contribute in developing products that help making the world a better place for all.</p>
